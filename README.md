## 😂 Fun Facts

- Stackzy
  uses [a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KBxVO5tXySbezBr-9rb2Y3qWo5PCMrvkD1aWQxZRepI/edit#gid=284770392)
  as the backend, thanks to [Retrosheet](https://github.com/theapache64/retrosheet)

- The initial name of Stackzy was `Which Stack`
- Stackzy uses a gloabl caching mechanism, which works as a centralized caching system. Means, if **someone**
  decompiled `WhatsApp`, the next time you try to find the stack, it won't be decompiled and the result will be served
  from the cache.
